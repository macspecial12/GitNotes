NOTE: use GitBash cmd line tool to put these tips to use
- sometimes it may need to be run as Administrator (right click)

Case 3. Pull an entire existing project from a REMOTE repo
    - Go to root project folder
    - Issue clone command to pull down REMOTE repo

    # launch GitBash
    cd ~/github_<username>/<projectname>    # change dir to the existing project
    git clone <url>
    
    # creates dir
    # inits dir
    # copies down files
    
    git branch -r
    # This becomes the defualt context (in this project directory) for fetch [pull] or push
    # Logical name: origin
    # Associated branch: master
    
    git remote -v                           # shows urls used for fetch, push; now you are tracking a LOCAL repo to a REMOTE repo
